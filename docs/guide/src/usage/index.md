# Usage

The Color System can be used in two ways:

1.  **Build Time (CLI)**: Generate a static CSS file with all your tokens. Best for performance and standard projects.
2.  **Run Time (Browser)**: Generate tokens on the fly in the browser. Best for user-customizable themes.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to understand the system is to play with the **Theme Builder**.

[**Open the Interactive Demo**](https://color-system-demo.netlify.app)

Once you have a configuration you like, you can export the `color-config.json` and use it with the CLI.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -D color-system
```
