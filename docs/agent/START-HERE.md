Read [active.md](./active.md) - this is your TODO list and implementation status.

## What just shipped?

Top of [changelog.md](./changelog.md) - last ~50 lines.

## Key architectural decisions?

Scan [decisions.md](./decisions.md) - search for your component/area.

## Project structure?

Current epoch plan: See [plan.md](./plan.md) for Epoch 44 (Architecture Clarity) details.

## Key RFCs?
