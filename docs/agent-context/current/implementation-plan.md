# Implementation Plan - Epoch 11: Phase 2 - Persona Refinement

**Goal**: Update personas based on recent learnings and feedback to ensure we are building for the right users.

## 1. Analysis

We have an existing `docs/design/personas.md`. We need to review it against the new `axioms.md` and the "Fresh Eyes" feedback to ensure the personas accurately reflect the users we are targeting.

**Current Personas:**
1.  The Overwhelmed Pragmatist
2.  The Visual Tinkerer
3.  The Conflicted Advocate
4.  The Color Scientist
5.  The System Alumnus

**Key Questions:**
- Do these personas align with the "Axioms"? (e.g., Does the "Visual Tinkerer" understand that "Accessibility is the Foundation of Aesthetics"?)
- Are we missing the "System Architect" who cares about the "Laws of Integration"?
- How do we frame the "Conflicted Advocate" now that we have a "Prime Directive" that resolves their conflict?

## 2. Proposed Updates

- **Refine "The Conflicted Advocate"**: Rename to **"The Accessibility Champion"** or similar. They are no longer conflicted; they are empowered by the system's axioms.
- **Refine "The Visual Tinkerer"**: Emphasize their need to understand *why* their palette is being constrained (The Laws of Physics).
- **Add/Refine "The System Architect"**: (Maybe replaces "System Alumnus"). Focus on the "Laws of Integration" and "Code as Source of Truth".

## 3. Execution Steps

- [ ] **Review `docs/design/personas.md`**: Read through the current descriptions.
- [ ] **Draft Updates**: Rewrite the personas to explicitly reference the Axioms where relevant.
    - *Example*: "The Overwhelmed Pragmatist relies on the 'Laws of Architecture' to make decisions without thinking about color."
- [ ] **Verify**: Ensure the new set covers our primary use cases (CLI user, Theme Builder user, Library author).

## 4. Verification
- [ ] **Alignment Check**: Do the personas feel like real people who would benefit from the system as defined in the Axioms?
