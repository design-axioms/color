# Phase Walkthrough

## Goals

Formalize the decision to use Standard CSS and limit build tools to bundling/optimization.

## Progress

- [x] Added **Axiom 10: Standard CSS First** to the Laws of Integration.
- [x] Clarified that tools like Lightning CSS are for bundling, not language extension.

## Key Decisions

- **Standard CSS First**: We reject proprietary extensions (Sass, etc.) in favor of spec-compliant CSS.
