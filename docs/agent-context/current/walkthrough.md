# Walkthrough - Epoch 11: Phase 1 - The Constitution (Axioms)

In this phase, we consolidated the project's design philosophy into a single authoritative document: `docs/design/axioms.md`.

## Key Changes

### 1. The Constitution (Axioms)
We updated `docs/design/axioms.md` to serve as the "Constitution" for the system. This document now includes:
- **The Prime Directive**: Accessibility is the foundation of aesthetics.
- **The Laws of Physics**: Lightness is relative, Chroma is expensive, Hue rotates.
- **The Laws of Architecture**: Surfaces are containers, Context flows down, Text is relative.
- **The Laws of Integration**: Code is the source of truth (Isomorphism), No magic numbers, Baseline Newly Available.
- **The Laws of Engineering**: State is a Domain Model (Classes with Runes).

### 2. Design Documentation Structure
We updated `docs/design/index.md` to better organize the design documentation:
- **Core Documents**: Axioms, Personas.
- **Deep Dives**: Hue Shift Rationale, State Architecture.
- **Audits**: Fresh Eyes Reviews.

## Rationale
As the project has grown (Svelte migration, new features), it was critical to have a single source of truth for our design principles. This ensures that future decisions (by humans or agents) remain consistent with the project's core philosophy.
