# Phase 3 Walkthrough

## Goals

The goal of this phase is to synthesize the findings from the Conceptual Integrity Review and establish a clear roadmap for the next stage of development. Since the audit found the system to be architecturally sound, the focus is on prioritizing future enhancements rather than fixing critical defects.

## Progress

- [x] Phase initialized.
- [x] Reviewed `ideas.md` and cleaned up outdated items (Debug Overlay).
- [x] Evaluated "Simplify Token Surface" and "CSS Bundling" as high-priority candidates.
- [x] Created `docs/agent-context/remediation-plan.md` outlining the roadmap for Epoch 34.

## Key Decisions

- **Epoch 34 Focus**: "Refinement & Education". We will focus on hardening the infrastructure (CSS Bundling), cleaning up the API (Simplify Token Surface), and improving user education (Interactive Tutorials).
- **Debug Overlay**: Confirmed as implemented and removed from the "Future Ideas" list.
