# Vision: A Physics Engine for Design

**Axiomatic Color is a Physics Engine for Design.**

We are not building a "Paint Set" (a collection of static colors). We are building a **Deterministic System** that generates accessible, harmonious, and adaptive interfaces from semantic intent.

## The Core Equation

$$
\text{Color} = f(\text{Context}, \text{Intent})
$$

- **Input**: Semantic Intent + Context.
- **Process**: Algorithmic Solver (Accessibility Constraints + Optical Physics).
- **Output**: Adaptive, Accessible, Harmonious UI.

## The Mission

To eliminate the conflict between **Aesthetics** and **Accessibility** by treating them as constraints in the same mathematical system.
