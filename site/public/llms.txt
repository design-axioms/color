# The Constitution (Axioms)

> **Status**: Living Document
> **Version**: 2.0 (Epoch 30)

This document serves as the "Constitution" for Axiomatic Color. It consolidates the core philosophy, physical laws, and architectural rules that govern the system. All design decisions and code changes must align with these axioms.

## Vision

**Axiomatic Color is a Physics Engine for Design.**

We are not building a "Paint Set" (a collection of static colors). We are building a **Deterministic System** that generates accessible, harmonious, and adaptive interfaces from semantic intent.

- **Input**: Semantic Intent + Context.
- **Process**: Algorithmic Solver (Accessibility Constraints + Optical Physics).
- **Output**: Adaptive, Accessible, Harmonious UI.

## The Axioms

The axioms are organized into domains:

### [0. The Fundamental Theorem](axioms/00-fundamental-theorem.md)

**Color = f(Context, Intent)**
Color is not a static value; it is a function. The system is a reactive dependency graph that resolves pixel values based on semantic intent and environmental context.

### [I. The Prime Directive](axioms/01-accessibility.md)

**Accessibility is the Foundation of Aesthetics.**
We reject the idea that accessibility and aesthetics are in conflict. Accessibility is the mathematical constraint solver that generates the palette.

### [II. The Laws of Physics (Light)](axioms/02-physics.md)

**Lightness is Relative. Chroma is Expensive. Hue Rotates.**
We model color as a physical phenomenon, respecting the non-linear nature of human perception (Bezold-Brücke effect, Gamut Cusps).

### [III. The Laws of Architecture (Surfaces)](axioms/03-architecture.md)

**Surfaces are Containers. Context Flows Down. Text is Relative.**
We organize UI elements into a strict taxonomy of Surfaces that establish Context for their children.

### [IV. The Laws of Integration](axioms/04-integration.md)

**Code is Truth. No Magic Numbers. Baseline Newly Available. Standard CSS First.**
We ensure consistency and interoperability by deriving everything from configuration and targeting modern web standards. We use build tools only for bundling and optimization, not for language extension.

### [V. The Laws of Engineering](axioms/05-engineering.md)

**State is a Domain Model. Testing is a Ratchet. Late Binding.**
We build maintainable, testable software that leverages the power of the browser's CSS engine for dynamic resolution.

### [VI. The Law of Static Projection](axioms/06-projection.md)

**Static exports are snapshots.**
Since the system is dynamic, any static export (JSON, PDF) is a lossy projection of the system's state at a specific moment. We must enumerate states explicitly in these formats.

## Missing / Implicit Axioms (To Be Formalized)

The following principles guide our work but have not yet been codified into Law:

- **The Law of Determinism**: Given the same configuration, the output must be bit-for-bit identical.
- **The Law of Lossless Interoperability**: We export to other formats (Tailwind, DTCG) without losing semantic meaning.
- **The Law of "Just Enough" Configuration**: We expose knobs for _intent_, not _implementation_.

## Thinking in Surfaces

<DemoWrapper>

**Static palettes are not enough for modern interfaces.**

In a dynamic UI, colors change based on where they live. A "gray" text needs to be dark on a white card, but light on a dark tooltip.

Axiomatic Color acts as a **Context Engine**. Instead of giving you a fixed list of colors, it gives you **Surfaces** that automatically adjust their content to fit the environment.

## The Core Concept

A **Surface** is not just a background color. It **sets the rules** for everything inside it.

When you place an element on a surface, you aren't just painting pixels. You are entering a new **Context**.

### 1. Surfaces Create Context

Every surface acts as a "Context Provider." It automatically sets a suite of CSS variables that determine how text, borders, and other elements should look _when sitting on that specific surface_.

<Diagram>
  <div class="mb-4 text-sm text-text-subtle">
    Click on any surface below to inspect its active tokens.
  </div>
  <ContextVisualizer client:load />
</Diagram>

In the visualization above:

1.  The **Page** sets the baseline context (Light Mode).
2.  The **Card** sits on the Page. It might be slightly lighter or darker, but it maintains the same **Solar Time** (Light text on Dark, or Dark text on Light).
3.  The **Spotlight** (the dark box) _inverts_ the time. It tells its children: "I am dark. You must be light."

### 2. Content Adapts to Context

Because of this architecture, your components become **portable**.

You don't write CSS like `.card .text` or `.footer .text`. You just write `.text-strong`.

- If `.text-strong` is on a white card, it resolves to black.
- If `.text-strong` is on a black tooltip, it resolves to white.

The component doesn't know where it is. The _Surface_ tells it how to render.

## The Hierarchy of Surfaces

We categorize surfaces based on their physical role in the UI, not their color.

### The Canvas

These are the foundations. They recede into the background.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-page"
    name="Page"
    description="The infinite backdrop."
  />
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-workspace"
    name="Workspace"
    description="A dedicated area for tools or navigation."
  />
</div>

### The Objects

These sit _on top_ of the canvas. They hold your content.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-card"
    name="Card"
    description="The primary container for information."
  />
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-card"
    tint="hue-brand"
    name="Tinted"
    description="A subtle grouping mechanism."
  />
</div>

### The Interactors

These are actionable. They invite touch.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-action"
    name="Action"
    description="Buttons, toggles, and controls."
  />
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-action-soft"
    name="Soft Action"
    description="Secondary interactive elements."
  />
</div>

### The Spotlights

These demand attention. They often break the current polarity to stand out.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-spotlight"
    name="Spotlight"
    description="Tooltips, toasts, and primary calls-to-action."
  />
</div>

**Note on Inversion**: Spotlight surfaces perform a "Hard Flip" of the theme. If your app is in Light Mode, a Spotlight surface forces its internals into Dark Mode (and vice versa). This ensures that native browser controls (like scrollbars and checkboxes) render correctly inside the inverted area.

## X-Ray Mode (Forced Colors)

What happens when the user turns on "High Contrast Mode" in Windows?

In this mode, the operating system strips away all background colors to ensure maximum legibility. This can be disastrous for modern UIs that rely on background colors to define structure (like a white card on a gray background).

Axiomatic Color handles this with **X-Ray Mode**.

When the system detects `forced-colors: active`, it automatically switches from "Rich Mode" (painting pixels) to "X-Ray Mode" (drawing outlines).

- **Rich Mode**: A card has a white background and no border.
- **X-Ray Mode**: The background becomes transparent, and a **Border** appears automatically.

This ensures that your UI structure remains visible ("Fail Visible") even when the user strips away the paint.

## Why This Matters

By thinking in surfaces, you stop fighting with contrast ratios.

1.  **Guaranteed Contrast**: The system calculates the foreground colors based on the background surface. If the surface changes, the text changes.
2.  **Automatic Dark Mode**: You don't design "Dark Mode" separately. You just define your surfaces, and the system flips the context.
3.  **Infinite Nesting**: You can put a Card inside a Sidebar inside a Page. The system handles the math to ensure distinctness at every level.

</DemoWrapper>

---

## Accessibility First

In most design systems, accessibility is a step you take _after_ you choose your colors. You pick a palette, check the contrast ratios, and then tweak them until they pass.

In the Axiomatic Color, accessibility is the **input**, not the output.

## The Solver is an Accessibility Engine

When you configure the system, you don't say "I want this specific shade of gray for my text."

You say: **"I want my text to be readable."**

The solver takes that intent and calculates the exact lightness value needed to achieve it. If it's mathematically impossible to achieve that contrast with your current background color, the solver will warn you or adjust the background to make it work.

### APCA: The Future of Contrast

We use the **Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA)**, the candidate method for WCAG 3.0.

Old contrast ratios (like 4.5:1) are simple math, but they don't match how human eyes work. They often fail to predict readability in Dark Mode.

APCA models **human perception**. It understands that:

1.  **Polarity Matters**: White text on black looks different than black text on white.
2.  **Weight Matters**: Thinner fonts need more contrast than bold fonts.
3.  **Context Matters**: The surrounding light affects how you see a specific element.

By using APCA, the system ensures your text is _actually_ readable, not just technically compliant.

### Mapping APCA to WCAG 2.1

While APCA is the future, we understand that many teams are legally required to meet WCAG 2.1 standards (AA or AAA).




The Axiomatic Color targets APCA values that **exceed** standard WCAG requirements. Here is a rough equivalence guide for compliance auditing:

<Diagram>
  <TokenLevelVisualizer />
</Diagram>

> **Note:** Because APCA is context-aware, these mappings are approximations. However, our baseline target of $L^c 75$ for even the subtlest text ensures that you are safely within the "accessible" range for almost all use cases.

## Automated High Contrast

Some users need more than just "good" contrast. They need **High Contrast**.

Usually, supporting this requires a separate "High Contrast Theme" that you have to maintain manually.

The Axiomatic Color generates this for you automatically. When you build your theme, it creates a `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block that:

1.  **Maximizes Range**: Pushes the Page background to pure Black/White.
2.  **Increases Contrast**: Bumps up the target contrast ratios for all text.
3.  **Reduces Noise**: Desaturates colors to reduce visual vibration.

The browser applies this automatically based on the user's OS settings.

## Forced Colors (Windows High Contrast)

For users with severe visual impairments who use "Forced Colors Mode" (like on Windows), the system maps your semantic surfaces to system colors.

| Surface          | Maps To      |
| :--------------- | :----------- |
| `surface-card`   | `Canvas`     |
| `text-strong`    | `CanvasText` |
| `surface-action` | `ButtonFace` |
| `text-link`      | `LinkText`   |
| `state-selected` | `Highlight`  |

This ensures that your app behaves like a native application for users who rely on these tools.

## Print is an Accessibility Feature

We treat "Print" as just another mode.

When a user prints your page, the system:

1.  **Forces Light Mode**: To save ink and ensure legibility on paper.
2.  **Removes Backgrounds**: Sets backgrounds to `white` (paper color).
3.  **Adds Borders**: Since backgrounds are gone, it adds borders to `surface-card` and other containers so the structure remains visible.

You don't need to write a print stylesheet. The system's "Physics" just adapt to the medium of "Ink on Paper."

## Quick Start

This guide will walk you through setting up the Axiomatic Color and building your first themed component.

## 1. Install & Initialize

Run the following commands in your project root:


  
    ```bash npm install -D @axiomatic-design/color npx axiomatic init ```
  
  
    ```bash pnpm add -D @axiomatic-design/color pnpm exec axiomatic init ```
  


This creates a `color-config.json` file with default settings.

## 2. Generate Assets

Now, generate the CSS and TypeScript definitions.


  
    ```bash npx axiomatic build --out ./src/theme.css npx axiomatic export
    --format typescript --out ./src/theme.ts ```
  
  
    ```bash pnpm exec axiomatic build --out ./src/theme.css pnpm exec axiomatic
    export --format typescript --out ./src/theme.ts ```
  


## 3. Build a Card

Let's build a simple "Card" component to see the system in action.


  
  
  First, import the CSS in your app entry point:
  ```tsx
  import './theme.css';
  ```

Then, create a Card component:

```tsx


export function Card() {
  return (
    <div
      className={tokens.surface.card}
      style={{ padding: "2rem", borderRadius: "8px" }}
    >
      <h2 style={{ color: tokens.context.text.high }}>Hello World</h2>
      <p style={{ color: tokens.context.text.subtle }}>I am a themed card.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

  

  
  
  First, import the CSS in your root layout:
  ```svelte
  <script>
    import '../theme.css';
  </script>
  <slot />
  ```

Then, create a Card component:

```svelte
<script>
  import { tokens } from "$lib/theme";
</script>

<div class={tokens.surface.card} style="padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px;">
  <h2 style="color: {tokens.context.text.high}">Hello World</h2>
  <p style="color: {tokens.context.text.subtle}">I am a themed card.</p>
</div>
```

  

  
  
  Link the CSS in your `<head>`:
  
  > **Note**: If you are using a bundler (like Vite, Webpack, or Astro), you should import the CSS file in your JavaScript/TypeScript entry point instead (e.g. `import './theme.css'`).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme.css" />
```

Then, write the markup using the utility classes:

```html
<div class="surface-card" style="padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px;">
  <h2 class="text-strong">Hello World</h2>
  <p class="text-subtle">I am a themed card.</p>
</div>
```

## CLI Reference

The `axiomatic` CLI is the primary tool for generating your theme tokens.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -D @axiomatic-design/color
# or
npm install -D @axiomatic-design/color
```

## Usage

```bash
npx axiomatic [command] [options]
```

## Commands

### `init`

Scaffolds a new configuration file in your project.

```bash
npx axiomatic init
```

**Behavior:**

- Checks if `color-config.json` exists.
- If not, creates it with the default configuration (including the `$schema` reference).
- If it exists, exits with an error to prevent overwriting.

### `build` (Default)

Generates the CSS tokens based on your configuration. If no command is specified, this is the default behavior.

```bash
npx axiomatic build [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--config <path>`: Path to your JSON configuration file. (Default: `./color-config.json`)
- `--out <path>`: Path where the generated CSS will be written. (Default: `./theme.css`)
- `--watch`: Watch for changes in the config file and rebuild automatically.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use defaults
npx axiomatic build

# Watch mode
npx axiomatic build --watch

# Custom paths
npx axiomatic build --config ./design/colors.json --out ./src/variables.css
```

### `export`

Exports your theme tokens to other formats (DTCG, Tailwind, TypeScript).

```bash
npx axiomatic export [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--format <format>`: The output format. Supported: `dtcg`, `tailwind`, `typescript`. (Default: `dtcg`)
- `--out <path>`: Output file or directory.
  - For `dtcg`: Defaults to `./tokens/` (Directory).
  - For `tailwind`: Defaults to `./tailwind.preset.js`.
  - For `typescript`: Defaults to `./theme.ts`.
- `--config <path>`: Path to config file.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Export DTCG tokens to ./tokens/ directory
npx axiomatic export --format dtcg

# Export as a single JSON file
npx axiomatic export --format dtcg --out tokens.json

# Export Tailwind preset
npx axiomatic export --format tailwind
```

### `audit`

Audits your configuration and generated theme for accessibility and logic errors.

```bash
npx axiomatic audit
```

**Checks:**

- **Schema Validation**: Ensures your JSON config matches the schema.
- **Contrast Compliance**: Verifies that all surfaces meet APCA contrast guidelines.
- **Polarity Logic**: Ensures "Page" surfaces are light in Light Mode, and "Inverted" surfaces are dark.

## Output

The `build` command generates a CSS file containing:

1.  **:root Variables**: Global tokens like shadows, focus rings, and data viz colors.
2.  **Surface Classes**: Classes for each surface defined in your config (e.g., `.surface-card`).
3.  **High Contrast Media Query**: A `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block with accessible overrides.

### Integration

Import the generated file in your main CSS entry point:

```css
@import "./theme.css";
```

---

## JavaScript API

The Runtime API allows you to manage the theme mode and sync it with the browser environment.

## `ThemeManager`

The `ThemeManager` class is the main entry point for runtime theme control.

```typescript

```

### Constructor

```typescript
const themeManager = new ThemeManager(options?: ThemeManagerOptions);
```

**Options:**

| Option             | Type                        | Default                    | Description                                                                 |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`             | `HTMLElement`               | `document.documentElement` | The element to apply the theme to.                                          |
| `lightClass`       | `string`                    | `undefined`                | Class to add in light mode. If omitted, sets `style="color-scheme: light"`. |
| `darkClass`        | `string`                    | `undefined`                | Class to add in dark mode. If omitted, sets `style="color-scheme: dark"`.   |
| `faviconGenerator` | `(color: string) => string` | `undefined`                | Function to generate an SVG favicon based on the current theme color.       |

### Methods

#### `setMode(mode: ThemeMode)`

Sets the active theme mode.

- **`mode`**: `"light" | "dark" | "system"`

```typescript
themeManager.setMode("dark");
```

#### `get mode()`

Returns the current configured mode (e.g., `"system"`).

#### `get resolvedMode()`

Returns the actual active mode (`"light"` or `"dark"`). If mode is `"system"`, this returns the OS preference.

#### `dispose()`

Cleans up event listeners (e.g., for system preference changes). Call this when unmounting your app or component.

### Interaction with Inverted Surfaces

The `ThemeManager` sets the global theme state on the root element. The generated CSS uses this state to automatically flip the `color-scheme` for inverted surfaces (like `surface-spotlight`).

No extra JavaScript is required to handle these local inversions.

## Helper Functions

### `updateThemeColor()`

Updates the `<meta name="theme-color">` tag to match the computed background color of the document body. This is called automatically by `ThemeManager`, but you can export and use it manually if needed.

```typescript


updateThemeColor();
```

### `updateFavicon(generator)`

Updates the favicon dynamically.

```typescript


updateFavicon(
  (color) => `
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 32 32">
    <circle cx="16" cy="16" r="14" fill="${color}" />
  </svg>
`,
);
```
