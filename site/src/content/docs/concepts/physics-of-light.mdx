If "Surfaces" are the atoms of the system, **Physics** is the law that governs them.

Axiomatic Color doesn't store a list of colors for every surface. Instead, it calculates them dynamically based on the environment.

## 1. Solar Time

Instead of a binary "Light Mode" vs "Dark Mode" switch, the system models time as a continuous cycle.

- **Noon**: Bright Day (Light Mode).
- **Midnight**: Deep Night (Dark Mode).
- **Twilight**: The transition zone.

Every surface in the system knows what "Time" it is. When you switch modes, you aren't swapping a stylesheet; you are moving the sun.

## 2. The Taper (Spatial Safety)

In the real world, you can't have a "Neon Black" or a "Neon White". As colors get very dark or very light, they lose their ability to hold saturation.

The system enforces this with **The Taper**.

Imagine a cone (or a "Bicone") in the color space.

- At 50% Gray, you can have maximum vibrancy.
- As you approach Black (0%) or White (100%), the available vibrancy tapers off to zero.

This ensures that no matter how you configure your theme, you never accidentally create a color that is "out of gamut" (impossible to display) or that vibrates uncomfortably against the text.

## 3. The Tunnel (Temporal Safety)

The most dangerous time for color design is **Twilight**. This is the moment when the background is 50% gray.

If we just linearly interpolated colors from Day to Night, the middle point would often be a muddy, low-contrast mess.

To prevent this, the system uses a **Tunneling** effect. As the system transitions through Twilight, it automatically dampens the vibrancy of all surfaces. It creates a "Diving Bell" of safety, ensuring that text remains legible even during the animation between modes.

## Why is this better?

In a traditional system (Hex codes), changing the background color breaks everything.

- "I made the background darker, now the cards are invisible."
- "I made the background lighter, now the text contrast is failing."

In the Axiomatic System, the solver **re-runs the physics simulation** every time the environment changes. It guarantees that:

1.  **Legibility**: Text is always readable, because the Taper prevents the background from eating the contrast.
2.  **Gamut Safety**: You can't pick an "illegal" color. The math won't let you.
3.  **Smooth Transitions**: Switching modes is a fluid, mathematical operation, not a jarring jump cut.
