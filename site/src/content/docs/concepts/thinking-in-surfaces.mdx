**Static palettes are not enough for modern interfaces.**

In a dynamic UI, colors change based on where they live. A "gray" text needs to be dark on a white card, but light on a dark tooltip.

Axiomatic Color acts as a **Context Engine**. Instead of giving you a fixed list of colors, it gives you **Surfaces** that automatically adjust their content to fit the environment.

## The Core Concept

A **Surface** is not just a background color. It **sets the rules** for everything inside it.

When you place an element on a surface, you aren't just painting pixels. You are entering a new **Context**.

### 1. Surfaces Create Context

Every surface acts as a "Context Provider." It automatically sets a suite of CSS variables that determine how text, borders, and other elements should look _when sitting on that specific surface_.

<Diagram>
  <div class="mb-4 text-sm text-text-subtle">
    Click on any surface below to inspect its active tokens.
  </div>
  <ContextVisualizer client:load />
</Diagram>

In the visualization above:

1.  The **Page** sets the baseline context (Light Mode).
2.  The **Card** sits on the Page. It might be slightly lighter or darker, but it maintains the same **Solar Time** (Light text on Dark, or Dark text on Light).
3.  The **Spotlight** (the dark box) _inverts_ the time. It tells its children: "I am dark. You must be light."

### 2. Content Adapts to Context

Because of this architecture, your components become **portable**.

You don't write CSS like `.card .text` or `.footer .text`. You just write `.text-strong`.

- If `.text-strong` is on a white card, it resolves to black.
- If `.text-strong` is on a black tooltip, it resolves to white.

The component doesn't know where it is. The _Surface_ tells it how to render.

## The Hierarchy of Surfaces

We categorize surfaces based on their physical role in the UI, not their color.

### The Canvas

These are the foundations. They recede into the background.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-page"
    name="Page"
    description="The infinite backdrop."
  />
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-workspace"
    name="Workspace"
    description="A dedicated area for tools or navigation."
  />
</div>

### The Objects

These sit _on top_ of the canvas. They hold your content.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-card"
    name="Card"
    description="The primary container for information."
  />
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-card"
    tint="hue-brand"
    name="Tinted"
    description="A subtle grouping mechanism."
  />
</div>

### The Interactors

These are actionable. They invite touch.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-action"
    name="Action"
    description="Buttons, toggles, and controls."
  />
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-action-soft"
    name="Soft Action"
    description="Secondary interactive elements."
  />
</div>

### The Spotlights

These demand attention. They often break the current polarity to stand out.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-content my-4">
  <SurfacePreview
    surface="surface-spotlight"
    name="Spotlight"
    description="Tooltips, toasts, and primary calls-to-action."
  />
</div>

**Note on Inversion**: Spotlight surfaces perform a "Hard Flip" of the theme. If your app is in Light Mode, a Spotlight surface forces its internals into Dark Mode (and vice versa). This ensures that native browser controls (like scrollbars and checkboxes) render correctly inside the inverted area.

## X-Ray Mode (Forced Colors)

What happens when the user turns on "High Contrast Mode" in Windows?

In this mode, the operating system strips away all background colors to ensure maximum legibility. This can be disastrous for modern UIs that rely on background colors to define structure (like a white card on a gray background).

Axiomatic Color handles this with **X-Ray Mode**.

When the system detects `forced-colors: active`, it automatically switches from "Rich Mode" (painting pixels) to "X-Ray Mode" (drawing outlines).

- **Rich Mode**: A card has a white background and no border.
- **X-Ray Mode**: The background becomes transparent, and a **Border** appears automatically.

This ensures that your UI structure remains visible ("Fail Visible") even when the user strips away the paint.

## Why This Matters

By thinking in surfaces, you stop fighting with contrast ratios.

1.  **Guaranteed Contrast**: The system calculates the foreground colors based on the background surface. If the surface changes, the text changes.
2.  **Automatic Dark Mode**: You don't design "Dark Mode" separately. You just define your surfaces, and the system flips the context.
3.  **Infinite Nesting**: You can put a Card inside a Sidebar inside a Page. The system handles the math to ensure distinctness at every level.
