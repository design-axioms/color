title: Alpha Limitations
description: Known limitations and gaps in the current alpha release of Axiomatic Color.
---

Axiomatic Color is currently in **alpha**. This means the core engine is stable and production-ready, but some ecosystem features are still in development. This page documents what works, what doesn't, and what's coming next.

## Known Limitations

### Container Query Support

The Inspector currently produces false positives and false negatives when analyzing styles inside `@container` query blocks. This is a known issue tracked for the **beta release**.

**Workaround**: Test container query scenarios manually or use browser DevTools to verify contrast ratios.

### VS Code Extension

A VS Code extension exists in the repository (`packages/vscode-extension/`) but provides no functionality yet.

**Status**: Community contributions welcome, or planned for post-beta depending on demand.

### ESLint Plugin

The ESLint plugin (`packages/eslint-plugin/`) currently contains only one rule (`no-browser-dialogs`) for internal use. More rules for enforcing Axiomatic patterns are planned but not yet implemented.

**Future**: Will include rules like `no-engine-internals`, `no-bridge-transitions`, and `require-surface-nesting`.

### Migration Guides

There are currently no migration guides for upgrading between alpha versions. We'll add these based on alpha feedback once we identify common breaking change patterns.

## What Works Well

These features are **stable** and ready for production use:

### Core Engine

- **Physics solver**: Deterministic, mathematically sound anchor calculation
- **Reactive pipeline**: CSS-only theme transitions with zero JavaScript overhead
- **Context propagation**: Automatic polarity/mode inheritance through surface nesting
- **Hue shifting**: Smooth chromatic adaptation for brand colors

### ThemeManager Integration

- **Runtime theme switching**: Instant, flicker-free transitions between themes
- **State persistence**: localStorage integration with SSR-safe hydration
- **Framework adapters**: React, Svelte, Ember, and vanilla HTML support

### Bridge API for Adapters

- **22 stable exports**: Semantic foreground, border, and accent variables
- **Contract enforcement**: Test-time validation for chrome compliance (Starlight example included)
- **Pay-as-you-go loading**: Adapters only load the bridge CSS they need

### Inspector Diagnostics

- **Contrast violation detection**: Flags WCAG failures with precise diagnosis
- **Provenance tracking**: Shows which CSS variables contributed to a computed color
- **Visual debugging**: Highlights affected elements in the page
- **Exception**: Container query support (see above)

### CLI Solver

- **Theme generation**: Generates consistent, accessible palettes from minimal input
- **Export formats**: Supports CSS, TypeScript, and DTCG (Design Tokens)
- **Config validation**: Schema-backed validation with helpful error messages

## Reporting Issues

**Before filing an issue**, check the [Troubleshooting guide](/reference/troubleshooting) for common solutions.

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or need clarification on intended behavior:

- **File an issue**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/design-axioms/color/issues)
- **Provide context**: Include your `color-config.json` and reproduction steps
- **Check existing issues**: We may already be tracking it

**Alpha feedback is critical to shaping the beta release.** We're especially interested in:

- Use cases we didn't anticipate
- Integration challenges with specific frameworks
- Documentation gaps or confusing explanations
