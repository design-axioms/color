title: Bridge API (Adapters)
description: How to map a host palette into Axiomatic bridge exports without “addressing the engine”.
---

This page describes the adapter **bridge API**: a narrow seam intended for integrating Axiomatic Color into a host system that already owns its palette variables and chrome.

Most consumers should *not* use bridge exports directly. Prefer semantic classes and exported tokens.

## What the bridge exports are

Bridge exports are a small set of CSS custom properties in the `--axm-bridge-*` family that adapters may read.

They exist to avoid two bad outcomes:

- depending on engine internals (`--axm-*` / `--_axm-*`), and
- spreading host-specific overrides throughout authored components.

## One-file rule

All host-variable integration should live in a **single adapter stylesheet** (a “bridge file”). That file is the only place where host variables and bridge wiring belong.

## Example mapping (conceptual)

{/* axm-docs:explanatory:start */}

```css
/* Adapter stylesheet (single boundary file) */
:root {
  /* Map host palette variables into Axiomatic bridge exports */
  --host-color-text: var(--axm-bridge-fg);
  --host-color-border: var(--axm-bridge-border-int);
  --host-color-hairline: var(--axm-bridge-border-dec);
}
```

{/* axm-docs:explanatory:end */}

## Continuity constraints (non-negotiable)

The bridge exports must not become a second animation driver.

- Do not transition `--axm-bridge-*`.
- Do not transition `border-color` in chrome while borders are bridge-routed.
- Do not use `border: … currentColor` for chrome borders; route borders through bridge exports (for example `--axm-bridge-border-int`).

These rules prevent “popping” where some chrome regions update on different ticks than the engine-driven transition.
