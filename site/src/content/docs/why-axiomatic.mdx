title: Why Axiomatic?
description: Dark mode shouldn't be this hard. Axiomatic makes it automatic.

## The Problem

Building a modern UI color system is harder than it should be:

- **Dark mode is a full rewrite**: You maintain two separate palettes, and they drift out of sync.
- **Accessibility is manual**: You're constantly checking contrast ratios and adjusting by hand.
- **Colors are context-blind**: A "gray" text needs different values on a white card vs. a dark tooltip, so you end up with `gray-50`, `gray-100`, `gray-200`... and you still guess wrong.

## The Solution

**Axiomatic Color automates the hard parts.**

You define semantic intent (this is a "card", this is "strong text"), and the system handles:

- **Automatic dark mode**: One palette, two appearances. The system inverts surfaces and recalculates contrast for you.
- **Guaranteed accessibility**: Text contrast is mathematically guaranteed using APCA (the future WCAG 3.0 standard).
- **Context-aware colors**: Components adapt to their environment automatically.

## Before vs. After

### Manual CSS (Traditional Approach)

{/* axm-docs:explanatory:start */}

```css
/* You maintain two versions of everything */
.card {
  background: #ffffff;
  color: #1a1a1a;
  border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
}

.card-title {
  color: #0a0a0a;
}

.card-subtitle {
  color: #737373;
}

/* Dark mode: rewrite everything and hope contrast is okay */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .card {
    background: #1a1a1a;
    color: #fafafa;
    border: 1px solid #404040;
  }

  .card-title {
    color: #ffffff;
  }

  .card-subtitle {
    color: #a3a3a3; /* Guessing this has enough contrast */
  }
}
```

{/* axm-docs:explanatory:end */}

### With Axiomatic

```css
/* One version. Dark mode just works. */
.card {
  @apply surface-card;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

.card-title {
  @apply text-strong;
}

.card-subtitle {
  @apply text-subtle;
}
```

The system handles light/dark switching, contrast calculation, and context adaptation automatically.

## Key Benefits

### 🌓 Dark Mode Just Works

Toggle between light and dark mode without maintaining two separate stylesheets. The system automatically inverts surfaces and recalculates all contrast ratios.

### ✅ Accessibility by Default

Text contrast is mathematically guaranteed. If your background changes, your text automatically adjusts to maintain the required contrast level. No more manual WCAG checks.

### 🎨 Semantic, Not Arbitrary

Instead of `color-gray-600`, you use `text-subtle`. The actual color value adapts to the context (page, card, tooltip) while maintaining the same semantic weight.

### 🚀 Modern CSS

Built on cutting-edge web standards: OKLCH color space, Relative Color Syntax, and CSS Custom Properties. No JavaScript runtime needed.

## When Should You Use Axiomatic?

**Great for:**

- Modern web apps that need dark mode support
- Design systems that value accessibility
- Teams that want to move fast without sacrificing quality
- Projects using cutting-edge CSS features

**Not ideal for:**

- Legacy browsers (requires OKLCH and Relative Color Syntax)
- Marketing sites that need pixel-perfect brand matching (Axiomatic prioritizes accessibility over exact color reproduction)
- Projects that can't use alpha-stage tools ([see limitations](/alpha-limitations))
